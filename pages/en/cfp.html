    <h1>Share an experience!</h1>
    <p>This year, the call for proposals concerns all interventions at Sud-Web 2018.</p>
    <p>There will still be a form of curation, but all subjects will go through this form so that the team can choose the programming in a concerted way.</p>
    <p>All forms of talks are possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>talk with visual support(s);</li>
      <li>lighting talk ;</li>
      <li>stand-up ;</li>
      <li>group activities…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not want you to feel trapped in the elaboration of a "traditional" talk. Find a format that make sense for you and with which you feel comfortable!</p>
    <p>Do you have an idea? Or several? <a href="#form">Do not hesitate to apply</a>. You have until:
       <strong><time datetime="2018-02-16T23:59">Feburary 16, 2018 at 11:59 pm</time> (Paris Time)</strong>
       to propose a talk (or several).</p>
    <p>We remind you that we'll favour:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>experience</strong> feedbacks ;</li>
      <li>what makes <strong>sense</strong> in your approach ;</li>
      <li>what you learned from this experience, <strong>the lesson(s)</strong> you acquired ;</li>
      <li>the <strong>changes</strong> you'll apply when you get back to work on Monday.</li>
